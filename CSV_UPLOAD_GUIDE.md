# CSV Upload Feature - User Guide

## Overview
The predictive maintenance model requires **24 timesteps (6 hours) of historical data** to make accurate predictions. We now support two methods for manual predictions:

### 1. **CSV Upload (RECOMMENDED - Most Accurate)**
Upload a CSV file containing actual 6-hour historical data from your vehicle.

### 2. **Quick Manual Input (Less Accurate)**
Enter current values only - the system simulates the past 6 hours.

---

## Why 24 Rows?

The LSTM model was trained on sequences of:
- **24 timesteps** √ó **15-minute intervals** = **6 hours** of continuous vehicle data
- This allows the model to learn temporal patterns and trends
- Single-point predictions are less accurate because the model can't see degradation patterns

## CSV Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Template
1. Go to the dashboard: `http://localhost:8001/dashboard`
2. Click on the "‚úçÔ∏è MANUAL: Test Prediction" tab
3. Click "üì• Download CSV Template"
4. You'll get a file named `ev_prediction_template_24rows.csv`

### Step 2: Fill in Your Data
The CSV must have **exactly 24 rows** with these **11 required columns**:

| Column | Description | Typical Range |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `Battery_Voltage` | Battery voltage in Volts | 360-380V |
| `Battery_Current` | Current in Amps | -100 to 100A |
| `Battery_Temperature` | Temperature in Celsius | 15-45¬∞C |
| `SoC` | State of Charge (0-1) | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `SoH` | State of Health (0-1) | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `Charge_Cycles` | Total charge cycles | Integer |
| `Distance_Traveled` | Total km traveled | Float |
| `Power_Consumption` | Current power usage (kWh) | Float |
| `Component_Health_Score` | Overall health (0-1) | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `Failure_Probability` | Risk of failure (0-1) | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `RUL` | Remaining Useful Life (days) | Float |

### Step 3: Upload and Get Prediction
1. Click "üì§ Upload CSV File"
2. Select your filled CSV file
3. The system will:
   - Validate the file (24 rows, required columns)
   - Engineer additional features
   - Scale the data using the same scaler from training
   - Run the LSTM model prediction
4. View results showing:
   - Data summary (voltage/SoC/health changes over 6 hours)
   - Maintenance probability
   - Cost analysis
   - Actionable recommendations

## Example CSV Data

Here's what 24 rows look like (showing gradual battery degradation):

```csv
Battery_Voltage,Battery_Current,Battery_Temperature,SoC,SoH,Charge_Cycles,Distance_Traveled,Power_Consumption,Component_Health_Score,Failure_Probability,RUL
380.5,45.2,28.5,85.0,95.0,100,45000,48.5,0.92,0.05,45
379.8,46.1,28.8,84.2,94.9,101,45100,49.2,0.91,0.06,44
379.2,46.8,29.1,83.5,94.8,102,45200,49.8,0.90,0.07,43
...
363.5,61.5,37.0,67.8,92.7,123,47300,64.5,0.69,0.28,22
```

Notice how values change over time:
- Battery voltage decreases (380.5V ‚Üí 363.5V)
- Temperature increases (28.5¬∞C ‚Üí 37.0¬∞C)
- SoC decreases (85% ‚Üí 67.8%)
- Failure probability increases (0.05 ‚Üí 0.28)

This temporal pattern is what the LSTM learns from!

## Common Errors

### "Expected exactly 24 rows, got X rows"
- Your CSV must have exactly 24 data rows (plus 1 header row = 25 total lines)
- Add or remove rows to match

### "Missing required columns"
- Make sure all 11 required columns are present with exact names
- Column names are case-sensitive

### "Failed to scale data"
- Check that numeric values are in reasonable ranges
- No null/empty values allowed

## Comparison: CSV Upload vs Manual Input

| Feature | CSV Upload | Manual Input |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Accuracy** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium |
| **Data Required** | 24 rows (6 hours) | 1 current state |
| **Temporal Patterns** | ‚úÖ Real patterns | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simulated |
| **Best For** | Production use | Quick testing |
| **Time to Setup** | 5-10 minutes | 1 minute |

## Auto-Refresh Dashboard

The main dashboard auto-refreshes every **15 seconds** but this is for **simulation purposes**:
- Each CSV row represents **15 minutes** of real time
- The dashboard simulates at **60x speed** (15 min in 15 sec)
- This allows quick demonstration of the model in action

For production deployment, you would:
1. Collect real data every 15 minutes
2. Store the last 24 timesteps in a rolling window
3. Run predictions every 15 minutes (or on-demand)
