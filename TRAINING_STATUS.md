### Current Status (Epoch 2):
- 🔄 Training in progress...
- Metrics improving epoch by epoch
- Expected completion: 5-10 minutes

## Expected Final Performance

Based on the data and architecture:

### Realistic Targets:
- **Accuracy:** 70-85%
- **Precision:** 40-65%
- **Recall:** 60-80%
- **F1-Score:** 50-70%
- **AUC-ROC:** 0.65-0.80

### Why These Ranges?
- Binary classification on imbalanced data (70/30 split)
- Real-world telemetry data with noise
- Class weights help but limit max accuracy
- High recall prioritized (catch failures > false alarms)

---

## Files That Will Be Generated

✅ **When training completes, you will have:**

1. `best_lstm_model.keras` - Trained LSTM model (ready for deployment)
2. `preprocessor.pkl` - Scaler + configuration (for inference)
3. `model_results.json` - Performance metrics in JSON format

### Sample `model_results.json`:
```json
{
  "model_type": "stacked_lstm",
  "sequence_length": 24,
  "prediction_horizon": 4,
  "n_features": 11,
  "accuracy": 0.7500,
  "precision": 0.5500,
  "recall": 0.7200,
  "f1_score": 0.6250,
  "auc": 0.7500,
  "total_parameters": 123329,
  "training_samples": 20983,
  "test_samples": 4497,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T..."
}
```

## What's Happening Right Now?

The model is learning patterns in the data:

### Epoch 1 Observations:
- Model started with ~50% accuracy (random guessing baseline)
- **High recall (99.92%)** means it's catching almost all maintenance events
- Low precision means it's predicting "maintenance needed" very frequently
- This is normal for early epochs with class imbalance

### Expected Progress:
- **Epochs 1-5:** Model learns basic patterns, recall stays high
- **Epochs 6-15:** Precision improves, model becomes more selective
- **Epochs 16-30:** Fine-tuning, balanced precision/recall
- **Early stopping may trigger** around epoch 15-20 if validation loss stops improving

## Next Steps After Training

Once training completes, you'll be able to:

### 1. Test the Model
```python
python realtime_api.py
# Dashboard at http://localhost:8000/dashboard
```

### 2. Compare with GRU
```python
# Optionally train GRU for comparison
python gru_predictive_maintenance.py

# Then compare
python compare_models.py
```

### 3. Use for Hackathon Demo
- Load the model in the dashboard
- Show real-time predictions
- Present cost-benefit analysis
- Demonstrate business value

## Troubleshooting

### If Training Fails:

**Out of Memory:**
- Reduce `nrows=30000` to `nrows=10000` in line 20
- Reduce `batch_size=64` to `batch_size=32` in training call

**Training Too Slow:**
- Reduce `epochs=30` to `epochs=15`
- Results will still be good for demonstration

**Poor Performance (<60% accuracy):**
- This is OK for hackathon demonstration
- Focus on the methodology, not perfect scores
- Explain: "Real-world data is challenging, production would use more data"
