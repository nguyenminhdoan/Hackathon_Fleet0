# Dashboard Model Comparison Integration Guide

## ✅ What Was Added

A new **"Model Comparison"** tab has been integrated into your existing EV Fleet Predictive Maintenance Dashboard!

## 📊 New Tab Features

### **Tab: 📊 Model Comparison**

The new tab includes:

1. **📈 Visual Charts** - All 5 comparison visualizations:
   - Key Metrics Comparison (bar chart)
   - Multi-Dimensional Performance (radar chart)
   - Performance Heatmap
   - Confusion Matrices Comparison
   - Model Efficiency Analysis

2. **📋 Live Metrics Table** - Dynamically loaded from JSON files:
   - Automatically reads from `improved_model_results.json` (LSTM)
   - Automatically reads from `gru_model_results.json` (GRU)
   - Automatically reads from `final_model_results.json` (LSTM+Attention)

3. **💡 Model Selection Guide** - Recommendations for:
   - Maximum Safety (Best Recall)
   - Cost Efficiency (Best Precision)
   - Balanced Performance (Best F1-Score)
   - Best Discrimination (Best AUC-ROC)

4. **📊 Smart Summary** - Automatically identifies:
   - Which model has the best Recall
   - Which model has the best Precision
   - Which model has the best F1-Score
   - Which model has the best AUC-ROC

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Generate Visualizations (One-Time)

First, generate the comparison charts:

```bash
python3 generate_model_comparison_report.py
```

This creates all the PNG files that the dashboard will display.

### Step 2: Open the Dashboard

```bash
open dashboard.html
```

Or double-click `dashboard.html` in Finder.

### Step 3: Navigate to Model Comparison Tab

Click on the **"📊 Model Comparison"** tab in the navigation bar.

## 📁 Required Files

For the tab to work properly, you need these files in the same directory as `dashboard.html`:

### **Visualization Files (Generated by report script):**
- ✅ `metrics_comparison.png`
- ✅ `radar_comparison.png`
- ✅ `performance_heatmap.png`
- ✅ `confusion_matrices_comparison.png`
- ✅ `complexity_vs_performance.png`

### **Data Files (Generated by model training):**
- ✅ `improved_model_results.json` (from LSTM training)
- ✅ `gru_model_results.json` (from GRU training)
- ✅ `final_model_results.json` (from LSTM+Attention training)

---

## 🔄 Updating the Comparison

### When You Train New Models:

1. **Train the models:**
   ```bash
   python3 train_improved_model.py    # LSTM
   python3 train_gru_model.py         # GRU
   python3 train_final_model.py       # LSTM+Attention
   ```

2. **Regenerate visualizations:**
   ```bash
   python3 generate_model_comparison_report.py
   ```

3. **Refresh the dashboard:**
   - Simply reload the page in your browser
   - The tab will automatically load the new data

---

## 🎯 What You'll See

### **Summary Section (Top)**
Automatically generated text like:
```
LSTM (Improved) has the best Recall (100.00%) - catches the most failures.
GRU has the best Precision (30.05%) - fewest false alarms.
LSTM+Attention has the best F1-Score (46.06%) - most balanced.
GRU has the best AUC-ROC (0.5649) - best discrimination ability.
```

### **Metrics Table**
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC | Parameters |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| LSTM (Improved) | 29.44% | 29.44% | 100.00% | 45.49% | 0.5007 | 587,649 |
| GRU | 34.24% | 30.05% | 92.93% | 45.42% | 0.5649 | 444,929 |
| LSTM+Attention | 31.04% | 29.92% | 100.00% | 46.06% | 0.5103 | 395,905 |

### **Visual Charts**
All 5 charts displayed in high quality with automatic fallback if images are missing.

### **Selection Guide**
Color-coded recommendations:
- 🟢 Green box: Maximum Safety
- 🟠 Orange box: Cost Efficiency
- 🔵 Blue box: Balanced Performance
- 🟣 Purple box: Best Discrimination

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Charts showing "Chart not available" message:**
**Solution:** Run the report generator:
```bash
python3 generate_model_comparison_report.py
```

### **Table showing "No model results found":**
**Solution:** Train at least one model first:
```bash
python3 train_improved_model.py
# OR
python3 train_gru_model.py
```

### **Tab not loading data:**
**Check:**
1. JSON files exist in the same directory as dashboard.html
2. Open browser console (F12) to see error messages
3. Make sure you're opening the HTML file (not viewing raw HTML)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep Models Updated**
   - Retrain periodically with more data
   - Regenerate comparisons after retraining

2. **Compare Before Deploying**
   - Use the tab to decide which model to deploy
   - Consider your priorities (safety vs cost)

3. **Share Visuals**
   - The PNG files are high-quality and ready for presentations
   - The HTML report can also be shared separately

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use this tab during development
   - Track improvements over time
