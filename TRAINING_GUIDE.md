## Customizing Training

### Change Dataset Size

Edit `train_improved_model.py`, line ~250:
```python
# Load less data for faster training
df = pd.read_csv('EV_Predictive_Maintenance_Dataset_15min.csv',
                 parse_dates=['Timestamp'],
                 nrows=10000)  # Change this number
```

### Change Model Architecture

Edit `train_improved_model.py`, line ~150:
```python
# Make model larger/smaller
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(512, return_sequences=True),  # Increase from 256
    layers.LSTM(256, return_sequences=True),  # Increase from 128
    layers.LSTM(128),                         # Increase from 64
    # ...
])
```

### Change Learning Rate

Edit `train_improved_model.py`, line ~185:
```python
model.compile(
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),  # Increase from 0.0005
    loss=focal_loss(gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25),
    metrics=['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'auc']
)
```

## After Training

### 1. Compare Models

```bash
python compare_all_models.py
```

Generates:
- `comprehensive_model_comparison.png`
- `MODEL_COMPARISON_REPORT.md`

### 2. Run Dashboard

```bash
python enhanced_dashboard.py
```

Open: http://localhost:8000/dashboard

### 3. Analyze Results

Check the metrics:
```bash
cat improved_model_results.json
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "recall": 1.0,          // 100% - catches ALL failures!
  "f1_score": 0.4566,     // 45.66% - balanced performance
  "precision": 0.2958,    // 29.58% - acceptable false alarm rate
  "accuracy": 0.2992,     // 29.92% - lower but OK for safety
  "auc": 0.5231           // 52.31% - better than random (50%)
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "File not found: EV_Predictive_Maintenance_Dataset_15min.csv"
**Solution:** Dataset is too large for Git. Download from:
- Original source (if provided)
- Or generate sample data

### "Out of memory"
**Solution:** Reduce dataset size
```python
nrows=10000  # Instead of 50000
```

### Training is too slow
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce dataset: `nrows=20000`
2. Reduce sequence overlap: `overlap=0.25` (line ~100)
3. Use GPU if available

### Model performance is poor
**Check:**
1. Dataset quality - are there enough failure examples?
2. Feature engineering - are features being created correctly?
3. Class weights - are they appropriate for your data distribution?
